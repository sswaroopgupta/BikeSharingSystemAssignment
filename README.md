## General Information
- A bike-sharing system is a service in which bikes are made available for shared use to individuals on a short term basis for a price or free. Many bike share systems allow people to borrow a bike from a "dock" which is usually computer-controlled wherein the user enters the payment information, and the system unlocks it. This bike can then be returned to another dock belonging to the same system.
- BoomBikes aspires to understand the demand for shared bikes among the people
* Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
* How well those variables describe the bike demands

## Conclusions
- It is possible to derive model to predict the demand for shared bikes from the data

## Technologies Used
- pandas
- math
- seaborn
- matplotlib
- statsmodels
- sklearn
- scipy
